# Executing our code, you might try different numbers of sheep such as 10, 1000, 
# and 10000. What if you asked for 1000000 sheep, your program might completely hang 
# or crash. Because you have attempted to generate a massive list of sheep, 
# your computer may be struggling to complete the computation.
# 把数据存储下来并且一次性返回

# The yield generator can solve this problem by returning a small bit of the results at a time. 
# Notice how yield provides only one value at a time while the for loop keeps working.
